# Azure-AI-Python-SDK

Getting started with Azure AI's Python SDK.

The following project achieves the following:

* Setting up Azure authentication from a local environment using service principals and environmental variables. This is much harder than it seems, as there is no single tutorial online that shows the whole process from beginning to end.

* Setting up and running a machine learning training job on an Azure Compute Cluster.
